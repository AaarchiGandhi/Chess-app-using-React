# Getting Started with Create React App

## Project Description

Chess App Development Project

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I developed a strong interest in chess, playing regularly with my father on Chess.com. I also began organizing chess tournaments and hosting Twitter Spaces for my community of over 150 members, where we have held over 20 chess sessions.

My interest in chess programming grew as I became more involved in the game. I was particularly fascinated by the underlying algorithm that governs chess moves. To learn more about this algorithm, I decided to develop a chess app from scratch in my spare time.

This project challenged me in a number of ways. First, I had to learn how to design and implement efficient algorithms for complex problems. Second, I had to learn how to work with large datasets and develop scalable applications. Third, I had to learn how to design and implement a user-friendly interface.

Despite these challenges, I was able to successfully develop a working chess app. This project allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the logic behind chess moves and to develop strong programming skills. It also gave me the opportunity to improve my user experience and project management skills.

In addition to the technical skills I developed, this project also helped me to strengthen my communication and collaboration skills. I worked closely with other developers and stakeholders throughout the development process to ensure the success of the project.

Overall, I am very proud of what I accomplished with this project. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that allowed me to learn and grow as a software developer.

I am still working on the chess app, and I am excited to continue improving its features and functionality. I am also interested in developing other chess-related projects, such as a chess engine or a chess training app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/AaarchiGandhi/Chess-app-using-React/tree/feature/chess-app) build with React.

I have hosted this project on this link :

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Steps for commit in Github :
    git add .

    git commit -m "your message"

    git push --set-upstream origin feature/chess-app


## Steps for hosting on Github Pages :
	
	npm install gh-pages

    npm install gh-pages --save-dev

	Set up GitHub Pages: 
	
		Once the code is pushed, you just need to go to your GitHub repository settings, go to the "Pages" tab and set the source to the gh-pages branch.
		
	That's it! Your Ionic project should now be deployed to GitHub Pages.
